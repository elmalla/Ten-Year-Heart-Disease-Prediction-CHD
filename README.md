## AI Prediction for heart diseases CHD in 10 years 

Heart disease refers to various types of conditions that can affect heart function. These types include: coronary artery (atherosclerotic) disease that affects the blood supply to the heart, valvular heart disease that affects how the valves function to regulate blood flow, cardiomyopathies that affect heart muscles, heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias) that affect the electrical conduction and congenital heart diseases where the heart has structural defects that develop before birth.

Heart disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality globally: it accounts for more deaths annually than any other cause. For example an estimated 17.9 million people died from heart diseases in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Over three quarters of these deaths took place in low- and middle-income countries.

Most heart diseases are highly preventable and simple lifestyle modifications(such as reducing tobacco use, eating healthily, obesity and exercising) coupled with early treatment greately improve their prognoses. It is, however, difficult to identify high risk patients because of the mulfactorial nature of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol et cetera. Due to such constraints, scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for predicting the disease.

Machine learning (ML), due to its superiority in pattern detection and classification, proves to be 
effective in assisting decision making and risk assesment from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare 
industry on heart disease.

In this notebook, I will be exploring different Machine Learning approaches for predicting wheather 
a patient has 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) using the [Framingham dataset ] that is currently 
availble for non comercial usage only.
